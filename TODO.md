# TODO

2023-07: Cannot build anymore with Node `v16.x`.

## Priority

- Re-create with up-to-date Vue + Dependencies
  - Refactor to Composition API
- Add Vue-Router to improve URLs
  - Add 404 page
- Add Pinia state management
  - Come up with demo use case

## Secondary

- Complete links (add other profiles?)

### Animations

- Pointer-event if no mouse?
- On mobile: Just follow scroll, pulse animate?
- Stronger 'tip' animation glow
